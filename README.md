To determine the content of the README file, we need to look at the information provided in the image. The image shows a list of files and folders in the repository, including "backend", "frontend", and "README". However, the content of the README file is not visible in the image.

Since the image does not provide the content of the README file, we can make an educated guess based on the information available. The repository is for a restaurant website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, so the README file likely contains information about the project, such as its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it.

A typical README file for a project like this might include:

- Project description
- Technologies used (MERN stack)
- Installation instructions
- Usage instructions
- Contribution guidelines
- License information

Here's an example of what the README file content might look like:
